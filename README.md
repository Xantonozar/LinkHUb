## Introduction

The Civil Engineering Resource Hub is designed specifically for Civil Engineering students. It provides a single portal to all departmental and academic links, organized semester-wise in an intuitive card-based layout. With the project’s clean, modern design and interactive features, the platform emphasizes the purpose of saving valuable time and boosting productivity.

Inspired by the [LinkHUb](https://github.com/Xantonozar/LinkHUb) project, this application leverages a dynamic MERN stack to deliver a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Centralized Resource Access:**  
  Access all academic and departmental links for each semester (1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, 3-2, 4-1, 4-2) from a single, unified hub.

- **Compelling Hero Section:**  
  A visually striking hero section with high-resolution backgrounds, animated SVG overlays, and a clear message that conveys the purpose: “All your academic resources in one place—save time, reduce effort, and boost productivity.”

- **Card-Based Semester Navigation:**  
  Interactive cards display every semester. Each card provides quick navigation to detailed resource pages with smooth hover effects and responsive design.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Optimized for all devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile—ensuring a seamless experience for every user.

- **MERN Stack Architecture:**  
  The project is built with React.js on the frontend, Express.js/Node.js on the backend, and MongoDB as the database, ensuring scalability and dynamic content management.

Usage

Landing Page:
The landing page features an engaging hero section that communicates the purpose of the website—centralizing all academic links to save time and boost productivity. A prominent "Explore Semesters" button directs users to a card-based grid featuring all the semesters.

Semester Navigation:
Clicking on any semester card (for example, "Semester 1-1") takes you to a detailed page that lists all relevant links for that semester (e.g., Fall '23, Spring '24, etc.).

Interactive UI:
Enjoy smooth animations, hover effects, and responsive transitions as you navigate the site. Each component has been optimized for a seamless and engaging experience across all devices.
